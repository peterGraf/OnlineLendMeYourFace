      <h3>NOTE: <br />We are not currently rendering deepfakes, but you can view our public videos as examples.</h3><br />
      
   <em><strong>Lend Me Your Face: Go Fake Yourself!</strong></em> is an online net art version of our participatory deepfake AI video project <em>Lend Me Your Face!</em>. It allows you to upload your own face and generate your own personal, private deepfakes of your face, animated by our selected public figures.<br /><br />
      
    If no one else is in the queue, the first deepfake will take about a minute to render. If there are too many other participants in the queue, you will get a note to try again later.<br /><br />

    You can close the browser window and come back later (on the same device!) to see your videos under <strong>View My Videos.</strong> Your private videos can ONLY be seen on your own device.<br /><br />
      
    Whilst your deepfakes are being generated, you can view public videos that we have permission to share.<br /><br />

    All your data, photos and videos remain private and anonymous, existing only on your private, anonymized view of the <em>Lend Me Your Face!</em> website. You can delete all your data at any time with the button <strong>Delete All My Data.</strong><br /><br />  
    
    Go Fake Yourself! was commissioned by <a href="https://thephotographersgallery.org.uk/lend-me-your-face" target="_blank"><strong>The Photographers' Gallery</strong></a> as a net art version of Lend Me Your Face! and is on exhibit 18 Jan. - 17 March 2021<br /><br />
