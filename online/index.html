   <em><strong>Lend Me Your Face: Go Fake Yourself!</strong></em> is an online net art version of our participatory deepfake AI video project <em>Lend Me Your Face!</em>. It allows you to upload your own face and generate your own personal, private deepfakes of our selected public personas.<br /><br />
      
    <strong>Upload</strong> a photo of your face to generate four private deepfake videos. If no one else is in the queue, the first deepfake will take about a minute, and after about 5 minutes all will be finished. If there are more than 5 people in the queue, you will get a note to try again later.<br /><br />

    You can always close the browser window and come back later (on the same device!) to see your videos under the button <strong>View My Videos.</strong><br /><br />
      
    While your deepfakes are being generated, you can see public videos that we have permission to share. Your private videos will be appear interspersed with the public videos as they are generated, and can be seen ONLY on your own device.<br /><br />

    All your data, photos and videos remain private and anonymous. They exist only on the <em>Lend Me Your Face!</em> website and you can delete all your data at any time with the button <strong>Delete All My Data.</strong><br /><br /><br /><br />
